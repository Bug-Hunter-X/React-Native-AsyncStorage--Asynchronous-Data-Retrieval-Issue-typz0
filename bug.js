This React Native bug occurs when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue arises when attempting to retrieve data before it has been fully stored. This might lead to unexpected behavior, such as receiving null values or stale data. This is often due to asynchronous operations not being handled properly. For instance, if you try to access the data immediately after calling `setItem`, the data might not be ready yet.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
AsyncStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue');
const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey'); // value might be null
console.log(value); // might log null
```
